# final_course_project_metagenomics
The final course project of Dr.Yanbin Yin's course in 2023 fall. The aim is to use algea microbiome sequencing data to do the whole analysis from raw reads to the gene annotation.


Update 11/25:
Before you run the metaspade and megahit, please check your fastq files if they are matched or not (use grep "@" -c your_fastq1 and your_fastq2).
Otherwise, you would waste 8 hrs and received errors.


Update 11/23:

change the bowtie2 and samtools into updated version
